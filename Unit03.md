**Unit 3: New Models of Development** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit will examine new theories in economic development that have
emerged as a result of earlier development theories failing to produce
predicted results. These new models center on market and coordination
failures. Market failures come in the form of externalities, increasing
returns, market imperfections, and distributional equity. Coordination
failures are the result of the absence of complementary activities,
which are necessary for a project to be successful. Some models deal
with poverty traps, geography, institutions, and social capital. Other
models, most notably the* *capacity approachto development, raise the
question of how to define development.*

**3.1 Coordination Failures, Poverty Traps and the Big Push** <span
id="3.1"></span> 
*The idea of the* Big Push *in development economics was first brought
to the attention of economists by Paul Rosenstein-Rodan in 1943. Simply
put, developing countries cannot do anything to lift themselves out of
poverty until they can do it in a big way. Among the reasons for this
idea is that there are indivisibilities in the production of goods and
services, in the demand for goods, and in the supply of savings.
Economies of scale can only be achieved when a minimum output can be
produced. This minimum output may be too large for any one firm or
individual. The theory provided an argument for government intervention,
because it argued that only the government can produce and buy at the
scale sufficient enough to overcome the indivisibilities. The theory
went out of fashion in the 1970s* *and 1980s as a result of the lack of
empirical evidence to support the idea. It has since been revived by
other economists, including Jeffrey Sachs and William Easterly.    *

**3.2 Geography as the Main Determinant of Development** <span
id="3.2"></span> 
*The idea that geography is destiny in economic development has been
with economists and non-economists for a long time. That the sun saps
the energy of people in the tropics and therefore makes them less
inclined to work, or that the prevalence of malaria-borne mosquitoes and
sleeping sickness-borne tsetse flies in the tropics sickens people and
effectively reduces the number of productive hours they can put to work
each day, is both anecdotally appealing and almost intuitive. In recent
years, several serious scholars have attempted to assess the impact of
such geographic impediments on economic development.*

**3.3 New Institutional Economics (NIE)** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*This subunit might properly be titled “Institutions Matter.” Taking its
cue from Ronald Coase’s two seminal articles, “The Problem of Social
Cost” (1960) and “The Nature of Man” (1973), the New Institutional
Economists (NIE) examine the role of institutions in furthering or
impeding economic development. Some of the institutions are property
rights, hierarchy, and social organizations. In a well-acclaimed book by
Henon De Soto,*The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the
West and Fails Everywhere Else *(2001), he argues that one of the
factors hindering economic development in poor countries is the
inability to make real estate (land) fungible. Since then, there have
been many others who have echoed that theme and other institutional
barriers.*

**3.4 Social Capital and Development** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*Social capital is one of those concepts in economic development which
is clearly borrowed from sociology but which has become an important
idea in the literature of economics. It represents social relations that
have economic or productive benefits. In today’s language, one could
substitute the term networking.*  
  
 *The World Bank defines social capital as “a set of horizontal
associations between people, consisting of social networks and
associated norms that have an effect on community productivity and
well-being. Social networks can increase productivity by reducing the
costs of doing business. Social capital facilitates coordination and
cooperation.”*  
    
 *The implications of social capital for economic development have been
exploited in many areas. For example, some micro financiers find that
the rate of recovery of loans is higher if the lending is made to social
groups rather than to individuals. The concept of susu or (rotational
savings) depends on the social networking group to make it work. One
cannot be in the rotational saving if one is not a member of the social
group. The group generates social capital with economic benefits; it
enables people to save or have access to capital which may not be easily
obtained any other way. *

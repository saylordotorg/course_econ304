This course introduces major theories of economic development and to
place them in a historical context. In his contributory introduction
“Economic Growth, Economic Development and Human Development” in *The
Development Economics Reader* (2008), edited by Giorgio Secondi and
published by Routledge, Secondi defines economic development as the
“branch of economics that studies relatively poor countries.” In the
same book, Mahbub ul Haq, writing under the title “The Human Development
Paradigm,” suggests that the “basic purpose of development is to enlarge
people’s choices,” which is in line with the views expressed by the
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. Whether development is simply studying poor
countries or expanding people’s choices in poor countries, one of the
essential requirements is that there must be a means for making the
choices available. This means that economic development must include
growth, but growth can take place without economic development. Without
economic growth, the choices cannot be expanded. At the same time,
however, economic growth can take place and people’s choices can still
be limited. Therefore, economic development requires economic growth,
but the inverse is not required. Indeed, Pearce defines economic
development as “the process of improving the standards of living and
well-being of the population of developing countries by raising per
capita income” (1992). In essence, theories of economic development
attempt to explain the process that *less developed countries* (LDCs) go
through to become *developed countries* (DCs). Further, because economic
development is more than economic growth and involves changes in all
aspects of the society, both social and political, the discipline tends
to be interdisciplinary, drawing from other social sciences such as
sociology and geography. In this course, in addition to discussing the
theories of development, we will also try to explain how the theories
are applied and how successful they have been in explaining the
development patterns of various countries. The oft cited example of
Ghana and Malaysia might be instructive at this point. Both countries
gained independence from the British in 1957 (Ghana a few months earlier
in March and Malaysia in August). At the time, both countries were
roughly at the same level of development. If you fast forward to the
2000s, Malaysia’s per capita GDP is five times that of Ghana’s per
capita GDP; it is $16,200 in Malaysia and $3,100 in Ghana. The literacy
rate in Malaysia is 88.7% and 67.3% in Ghana. Malaysia has 11 times more
physicians per 1,000 people than Ghana, and life expectancy is 74.04 in
Malaysia but 61.45 in Ghana. There are many questions which the
development economist wants the answers to, but mainly this boils down
to:  What accounts for the vast differences in the many measures of
human development indices? We study economic development to learn from
the *Malaysians* so that we can offer useful advice to the *Ghanaians*.
The units in this course are stacked as building blocks; each successive
unit depends on a thorough understanding of the previous unit. The
course begins with some of the stylized facts of the countries
classified as developing countries. You will find that they are not all
alike. Some countries, such as the oil rich ones, may have a very high
per capita GDP. You will learn the definitions of major terms and
concepts. The sections that follow the introductory unit outline the
major theories of economic development, tracing their development
throughout history as the dialogue on development economics has
progressed. Finally, the course will present a number of development
successes and failures and will prompt you to draw your own conclusions
on the validity of certain theories based on case studies.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   define economic development and its components;
-   describe major theories of economic development;
-   explain and apply some basic economic models related to economic
    development and economic growth, including the Solow Growth model
    and its extensions;
-   identify and discuss economic development theories in the social and
    political context in which they were created; and
-   critically examine economic development theories in light of a
    history of poor performance in development programs.

 √    have access to a computer;  
  
 √    have continuous broadband Internet access;

### Course Information

Welcome to ECON304: Economic Development. General information about this
course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Samuel K. Andoh  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This coursecomprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, it makes primary use of the following
materials:  

-   The World Bank’s *Beyond Economic Growth*
-   University of Iowa, Center for International Finance and
    Development: *[E-book on International Finance and
    Development](http://blogs.law.uiowa.edu/ebook/uicifd-ebook)*

**Requirements for Completion: **Before taking this course, you should
have completed ECON101: Principles of Microeconomics and ECON202:
Principles of Macroeconomics. These pre-requisites lay the foundation
for understanding the advanced material in ECON304. Pay special
attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for understanding the
more advanced, exploratory material presented in the latter units of
this course. You have to work through each unit of this course and all
of its assigned materials. You will also need to complete:  

-   Unit 1 Activities
-   Subunit 2.5.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.5.3 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.6 Assessment
-   Unit 2 Activity
-   Unit 3 Activity
-   Subunit 4.3 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for it, you will need to work
through the assessments and activities listed above as well as all of
the reading material in the course.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you a total of
approximately **61 hours**. Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. The
time advisory includes the estimated time you should expect to devote to
reading through the resources and completing any assignments that may be
included. These should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 12 hours to
complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday night; subunits
1.2 and 1.3 (a total of 4.5 hours) on Tuesday night; subunits 1.4 and
1.5 as well as the activity (a total of 4 hours) on Wednesday night;
etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It is important to pay close attention to the new
terminologies you encounter in this course and every other course. You
may think you know what words mean, but as used by economists, these
words have technical meanings. Spend the time to study the new
vocabulary, and it will pay handsome dividends.

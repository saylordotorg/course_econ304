**Unit 2: Traditional Theories of Economic Development** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to the four periods of economic
development that traditional schools of thought have identified:*  
  
 *1.    linear-stages-of-growth models,*  
 *2.    theories and patterns of structural change,*  
 *3.    international-dependence theories and structuralism, and
neo-classical models.*  
  
 *This overview will be followed by in-depth explorations of each
school. Linear-stage models see economic growth and development as
proceeding in linear fashion with the economy moving from one stage to
another and to another. The most famous of the linear-stage models is
the one propounded by W.W. Rostow. Rostow saw five stages of growth:*  
  
 *1.    the traditional society,*  
 *2.    pre-conditions for take-off,*  
 *3.    take-off,*  
 *4.    drive to maturity, and*  
 *5.    the age of high mass consumption.*  
  
 *Rostow looked at how the Western world, in particular, went through
the process of economic development and concluded more or less that all
countries must go through the same stages. The beauty of the stages
approach is that policy makers only need to ensure that the conditions
exist in order to usher in the next stage of the development path. If
there is one thing we have learned about economic development, it is
that it is not easy to generalize the process. The processes appear to
vary from region to region and sometimes from country to country. Harrod
and Domar’s model is another linear-stage model. The model sees savings
as essential to development and, in some sense, the only necessary
input. The more a country saves, the more it grows. Savings of course is
necessary but not sufficient.*  
  
 *The structural change models look at how the economy develops or grows
by changing its structure. How does a predominantly agricultural economy
become an industrial economy? Among the several theories trying to
explain such structural change is one by Arthur Lewis. Structural
changes can be sparked by population changes, resource changes, or
government policies.*  
  
 *Dependency theories have their roots in colonialism and post
colonialism. Proponents of these theories argue that developing or poor
countries have their own structures that are different from those which
modernists would like to see prevail. There is also the assertion that
rich developed countries like to see the poor countries in a state of
submission in order to provide the raw materials that developed
countries need for their industries at low costs. The response from the
developing countries, particularly in the early 1960s in Latin America
was rapid industrialization.*  
  
 *Neo-classical growth models relate back to neo-classical economics.
Neo-classical economists argue that growth is a function of the factors
of production (capital, labor) productivity and technological change.
They represent extensions of the Harrod-Domar model, and the most
popular one now is the Solow Growth Model. You may have noticed that
many of the models talk about growth not development. Economists like to
talk and write about things they can measure.*

-   explain the similarities and differences among the various theories
    and between any two theories;
-   explain why any selected theory explains the development process
    better or worse than another theory;

    to improve economic performance.

**2.1 Overview of Theories of Economic Development** <span
id="2.1"></span> 
*Early* traditional theories *of economic development drew lessons from
the experiences of the West (mostly Europe and North America) as well as
the experience of re-building Europe after the World Wars. Other
theories were conceptualized by intellectuals from developing countries;
these adopt a view from the bottom. In the context of the Cold War,
these theories are heavily influenced by the debate on economic
structure taking place between the market-oriented West and the
Communist countries.*

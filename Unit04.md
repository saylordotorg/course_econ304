**Unit 4: Conclusion** <span id="4"></span> 
*This final unit (the conclusion to the course) will ask you to compare
development theories once more, considering them in light of the
experience of developing countries. The first reading will present a
number of case studies of development success stories in Africa. An
online documentary provides a second opportunity to try to identify
development theories in action.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 5.5 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 3.5 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   explain the extent to which the theories explain the development
    process in any country;
-   analyze success and failure stories to isolate critical factors; and
-   critique development theories and policies.

**4.1 Explaining Development** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*So far, we have been discussing various theories that try to explain
the development process. Economics, unlike physics or chemistry, does
not easily lend itself to experimentation; identifying the factors
responsible for success or failure ex post is not easy. When the
development process succeeds or fails, it is often the result of several
factors and not the result of a single factor. Nonetheless, there are
times when we can point to the factors that caused success or caused
failure. A good way to understand the issues is to actually read cases
and try to isolate common factors. That is the reason why the collection
of cases below is important. The full document is 34 pages long and
lists the experiences of several African countries.*

     Instructions: Read the following case studies from Devarajan’s
    blog: “Achieving Shared Growth in Post-Stabilization Mozambique,”
    “Rebuilding Local Governments in Post-Conflict Sierra Leone,”
    “Leveraging Regional Markets to Build a Domestic Manufacturing
    Sector in Africa,” and “Rural Electrification in Mali.” Pay close
    attention to the information in the case studies as the exercise
    which follows will attempt to connect these case studies to a number
    of the theories we have studied throughout the course.  
        
     Reading these case studies should take approximately 1 hour.

**4.2 Analyzing Success and Failure** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Many of the cases highlight successes, yet with some of the successes,
we read about the need to overcome difficulties and risks that could
derail the achievements. As you read through the cases, think of the
dangers and how they can be mitigated. It is important to be able to
relate the successes and failures to one or more theories that we have
studied. If no theory can explain the successes, then it might be
worthwhile to note that too.*

**4.3 Formulate/Critique a Simple Development Plan Based on the
Theories** <span id="4.3"></span> 
*In reading through the case studies, sometimes it is not obvious
whether the success or failure was due to any one particular
theory/policy or another, and whether or not there are any lessons to be
learned. For example, the piece by Ahmad (link below) takes aim at the
failure of secular theories to explain development in general and
Islamic societies in particular. You may not agree with some of his
contentions, but culture and institutions seem to matter and these are
things some societies take for granted, because it has always been the
way of life. This story is not very different from Hernando De Soto’s
contention in* The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the
West and Fails Everywhere Else *that the most important factor in the
development of western economies is how western societies have succeeded
in making the capital tied to land fungible, while in many developing
countries it is not so. In De Soto’s view, neo-classical economists
hardly talk about this, because in the western world, private ownership
of property goes without saying. Yet, private property ownership of land
and the ability to sell or take equity in it encourages
entrepreneurship. Economic growth and economic development thus appear
to be inextricably linked to institutions and culture.*
